Issue-1
--------
'algorithm' file not found

solution: add below to yoga.podspec file

  spec.public_header_files = 'yoga/Yoga.h', 'yoga/YGEnums.h', 'yoga/YGMacros.h'

Issue-2
--------
'folly/folly-config.h' file not found

Solution: add these files to exclude list in React.podspec
            "React/Fabric/*",
